  <!--<p>Keep in mind that this is (obviously!) a very subjective scoring system. It doesn't even explain the particular elements that go into it. It's more about my reaction to the book and how it affected me as a person. Often times, when I read the book has a lot to do with the score. For example, there is a part in Nemesis Games by James S.A. Corey that helped me understand grief, growing up, and what makes me a terrible (and normal) person. It helped me grappel with one of the hardest moments in my life so far better than any therapy or self-reflective meditation session ever has.  It gets a 9.  Serioiusly, only one book has ever scored higher for me than Nemesis Games.</p>

<h2>My Scale:</h2>
    <p><b>10</b> - A Masterwork.  It feels like it is or should be a major contribution to human society. There are probably a lot of things about this book that I don't like, but that are also completely necessary for it to work.  It probably has critical acclaim, and the author is probably dead already.</p>
    <p><b>9</b> - Affects who I am on a day to day basis. I feel like I understand myself better after reading, or like the world is more complicated than I had previously thought. It opens my mind. Characters are real; the world is real; the conflict compells me. People who read these books will understand me better as a person.</p>
    <p><b>8</b> - I can't stop thinking about it. It emotes irrational emotional response. I'm pissed if they turn it into a movie, but they probably turn it into a movie. This is also for books that open up my thinking to something new, or make me think about the world differently. I'm probably going to have to explain ask Becca to sit and listen to me talk about this at some point while I'm reading it - whether she gets it or not.</p>
    <p><b>7</b> - Supremely entertaining. I probably laughed out loud, cried, or found myself looking like an idiot at some point while reading. Also for really intreaguing books.  I have to chew on them for a while when I'm done with them.</p>
    <p><b>6</b> - A great read.  I would recommend it to anyone. Would make a fantastic movie. The characters are real, the conflict is coherent.</p>
    <p><b>5</b> - I struggled to make it through the whole book, but it had redeeming qualities. It was somewhat entertaining. Like binge watching old TV shows - you're almost embarrased to be doing it, but it beats whatever else I'd be doing at the time. When I think back on the story and characters a few months later, I probably can't remember the title of the book or the author.</p>
    <p><b>4 </b>- I tried to read it, but I gave up on it. I literally didn't finish the book. It was better to commute home in silence than to finish that garbage. If I didn't actually give up on the book, I wish I had in hindsight.</p>
    <p><b>Below a 4</b> - I don't read garbage. I've got a particular taste in what I like and everything else is a waste of my life. I'm assuming this is where crappy romance novels and teen fiction go.  I love a lot of people who love those kinds of books...I'm just not one of them.  Everything below a 4 doesn't get a score.</p>

<!-- <br></br>
    <p>Another note: some of these books will be reviewed together, even though they're actually a series. For example, you can't read the Foundation series as 3 books. It's really just one book split into three volumes. For those books like those, I'm trying to handle them together. For some, I'll probably just do a series review once I finish it (Name of the Wind series will probably be this)</p>
