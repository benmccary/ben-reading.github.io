about-author: >
  I'm Ben. I work in Seattle, but live outside of it...I commute a lot. Basically,
  that means that I only get a few hours a day at home and have no time for life.
  Like most people like me, I listen to audiobooks.  Over the years, I've come to
  love them. So much so I can't get anyone to listen to me talk about them. So, I'm
  making a blog to talk about them so other commuters can find some good things to
  waste away in traffic to!
