&lt;h2 id=&quot;spoilers-nope&quot;&gt;Spoilers? Nope.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer is a fantastic read, and I would recommend it to anyone.  I am relatively new to the bio-punk genre, and I’m not even sure if this sits squarely in it, but I’ve been loving it. And not just for the genre, the book itself was suspenseful journey into…well, it was definitely something, though I have no idea what.   Let’s say this, there’s a creepy freshwater dolphin, a mysterious swamp monster who moans in the night, and a secret government agency trying to cover the whole thing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t usually go in for mystery thrillers, and while this one is creepy at times, it’s definitely something different altogether. It’s weird, mysterious, and gives a sense of ominous doom that makes it hard to walk away from. It also left me thinking after I was done. A total win in my book. (Full disclosure, I just realized that they’re making this into a movie in 2018 as I was writing this post so, now I feel kind of silly reviewing something that a lot of people may actually watch.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve always had a soft spot for a strong stoic female lead. And who wouldn’t want to read about a creepy person-eyed dolphin?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s start of with the basic premise: there is a mysterious Area, aptly named Area X, where a similarly mysterious government agency called the Southern Reach send expeditions from which no one returns…except those who do! That’s right! Sometimes, people come back from this secret Area X, but when they do, they’re changed. They don’t remember anything, they’re lucid, but never really able to engage with the normal world.  For some reason, people keep going into Area X to plumb it’s depths, but to no avail. The area is transitioning into some other type of ecosystem, but no one knows what - only that it’s expanding…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story follows the journey of an all female expedition, made up of a Psychologist, an Anthropologist, a Surveyor, a Linguist, and a Biologist. Our story follows the Biologist and her observations of the dangerous and mysterious world of Area X.  And for good measure, there’s dolphin with the eyes of a human. I’ve always had a soft spot for a strong stoic female lead. And who wouldn’t want to read about a creepy person-eyed dolphin?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story follows the Biologist as she treks through Area X, all the while recalling the life before hand that brought her there. It speaks of her fascination with wilderness, as well as her frustration with the modern, mundane world of civilization. The descriptions of Area X are visceral depictions of a gray and brown wintry marshland. In it, everything seems as it should be on it’s surface, but it’s permeated by a profound wrongness that’s hard to describe. VanderMeer does so by explaining the different character’s discomfort with their surroundings. On the other hand, as the Biologist explains her back story, the scenes seem to be painted in a sepia-toned haze. she’s had to experience wilderness as it pops up in the interstices of civilization, observing the wonder of nature small havens of quickly disappearing wild. In reality, the whole story only takes place in a few different locations, but they are all very sharply divided: mundane civilization, and majestic nature as it crops up in the interstices of civilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most fascinating aspects of the book is simply how odd the Biologist is. It was actually somewhat offputting as I read. For one part, since she was so unengaged with the rest of the world, she was hard to relate to, even to me, a pretty staunch introvert with mild to medium social anxiety.  VanderMeer tries to handle this by filling in the main characters with back story to explain any social awkwardness. For example, the Psychologist is shown to be lacking in confidence because of the pressure of her leadership role. With that said, these back stories are largely lacking. The Biologist describes a breakdown in a relationship because “he’s gregarious and I”m not”. That felt like glossing over what turns out to be a pretty central theme in as the story develops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/annihilation_map.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Annihilation Map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, one character is haunted by dreams for most of his life, only to realize that the dreams were scenes from a movie and not to be feared. It was a pretty simple conclusion to what would, in reality, be an extremely tragic childhood. That flatness of characters and simple glossing over of facts was beneficial because it added to the mystery of the story, but it felt more like shorthand than actual intentional plot. It was as if VanderMeer is saying, “just trust me, these people don’t get along”, or “I know there’s a plot hole later on, so I’m going to add a random piece of back story here.” It wasn’t bad, but I often found myself just needing to take characters at face value instead of really grocking with their motivations and actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, the basic premise was enough to make me hooked. Like I said, not mystery thriller feel of it isn’t the type of story I’d typically be interested in (I’m a wimp so I’ll probably hate the movie). But that’s really not what did it for me. What caught me was the fact that the concepts the book explores are actually scary in real life.  I am scared of how human actions are affecting the environment. The very premise of the Ben Reading blog is that I commute a lot and listen to a lot of audiobooks! It really hits close to home for me because - sorry for the tangent here - I work in a part of Seattle that’s really hard to get to via public transit. Taking the bus would add at least an hour and a half to my already 2.5 hour daily commuting.  So every day, I sit there spewing poison into the environment because I can’t find a better way to get to work!  Its crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading a book where nature is truly uncontrollable reminds me that nature is…truly uncontrollable. The story isn’t exactly terrifying, and as far as being a mystery thriller, it falls flat in a lot of ways. But in engaging with a real fear that so many of us hold, it is insightful and…down right creepy. So often, I rationalize my own life decisions saying, it’s out of my control, or we’ll have to wait till another generation gets public transit figured out. It’s easy to just pawn the problem off on a far off generation to let them deal with, but consequences will come eventually.  There’s even a moment in the story where one of the characters ponders whether it would be better to just leave the problem of Area X for a future generation! In the book, a theory develops that Area X’s danger ebbs and flows in cycles which to me was reminiscent of so many uncontrollable natural phenomena - hurricane season, tidal rise, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Reading a book where nature is truly uncontrollable reminds me that nature is…truly uncontrollable. In engaging with a real fear that so many of us hold, it is insightful and…down right creepy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That in and of it self is an interesting take on scifi, but VanderMeer’s execution is what is so fantastic about the book. Part of what makes the tension so palpable is in the imagery and general tone given to each environment the Biologist describes.  For example, those sublime moments of wilderness that the Biologist cherishes are wrought in full color, but always dark, gloomy, and filled with unctuous decay. It’s as if wilderness is relegated to the places humans forgot. And her melancholy describes what a tragedy this is; she views herself as an oddity for even noticing.  Yet ‘civilization’ is depicted in a sepia-toned tableau of proper social settings. She’s out of place, but also the people seem so unaware that their lives mean nothing. For the Biologist, ‘civilization’ died to her long before she chose to enter Area X, probably never to return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, more than anything, strikes me as an amazing philosophical commentary: in the world of Area X and the Southern Reach, civilization is a thing of the past; only wilderness, uncontrollable, wild, and dangerous remain.  And it’s only in Area X that this reality is made painfully clear. The transformations that happen to the environment are only a glimpse of the transformations that society would have to undertake where they to keep from disappearing. And if nature always wins, what possible fate is left to the rest of us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annihilation doesn’t give us an answer to that. In fact, it asks us whether that would actually be a bad thing.  Personally, I loved it. I loved how it made me think, how it made me worried, and the world was so real to me as I was in it. It was a sad, depressing world, but it wasn’t so far different from 2.5 hours a day stuck in a car, except for the mutant dolphins and swamp monsters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommendation: read it, but only if you’re ok with not liking the movie that much. The book will be better. At least you’ll be able to tell your friends that you liked the book more than the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spoilers-yeah&quot;&gt;Spoilers? Yeah.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-the-book-is-56-years-old-so-who-cares&quot;&gt;(but the book is 56 years old, so who cares)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heinline is a legend. No one could take that from him, and I’m just a guy who listens to (scifi) books in my car, so he wins.  With that said, I didn’t really like this book.  One of the important things to remember is that my rating is subjective - really subjective.  I’m basically just putting my reactions out there, and this book didn’t do much for me.  The only reason why it was worth reading was to get a glimpse of what people were thinking in the late 50’s early 60’s.  And for that, it was fascinating. For one thing, that time period is a bit of a no-man’s land for me. I’m not huge into American history, so I know WWII was going on in the early 40’s, and the mid-late 60’s was all about hippies and Civil Rights. But between those? I guess that’s where you get Heinline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that, there are some things that you just have to choose to stomach if you want to read this book. For one, it’s hopelessly sexist. As I was first reading it, I though, “Oh, Jill has a bit of spine, that’s good to see.” But as I read on, I realized that as soon as the plot was ready to make a man the main protagonist, Jill (and every other woman in the story) took a back seat as spunky, perky ornamentation for the scenes while the men did the talking. The sexism was rampant as far as only valuing the women for their physical features, but it was most upsetting that whenever the men were talking, the women just weren’t interested. They had no need for silly things like ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing you’d just need to stomach is that this book is written from the perspective of an upper-class white man. All others need not exist. That’s kind of what you get when you read Heinline. He uses science fiction as a medium to talk politics or philosophy, but he tends to do it sort of as a soap box.  It’s kind of why I love Heinline: he’s a true science fiction writer. He takes a concept or fear and extrapolates it into an imaginary world.  Ultimately, the conflict and plot in his stories are secondary to the dialogues that explain the ideas of interest. In this particular treaties, he’s interested in religion as a social power structure. I could imagine how that could have been an interesting concept at the time - the problem is that his take on that is that of a (probably) wealthy white man.  Social power structures and the assumptions behind them are very different to people of different walks of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/stranger2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stranger Cover&quot; text-align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those two problems are enough for me to want to give the book a low score and make it a “don’t bother recommendation”, that’s really not the whole picture. While I didn’t like those things, I can recognize that, for his time, he was trying to give women more respect than they got in other stories.  I’ve only read a little bit from the 50’s and it’s not much different.  Also, he’s giving women full sexual freedom, which I’m sure was a revolutionary idea at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, the main reason I didn’t care for the book was because I wasn’t particularly interested in his topic of choice. In Seattle 2017, religion as a social power structure isn’t particularly valid topic. I am an ordained minister. I have been through bible school at one of the most reputable religious universities in the region, I got a masters degree from Princeton Theological Seminary, and have worked as a protestant minister in churches since 2010 - and not once have I seen religious hold any significant social power over anyone. In the places I’ve lived, religion is just grasping at anything it can to get a seat at the table of social discourse. That’s why so many religious people become so angry and fanatically conservative: they want some proof that their beliefs, traditions, and habits actually matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a harsh critique of religion, and I’m a very religious person. I’ve got all kinds of ideas about why those things have happened, how to fix them, and all that. But, 1) that’s not what this blog is about, and 2) none of those ideas paid the bills, so I’ve moved on to paying gigs since…hence the whole working in Seattle and having the long commute that precipitated this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am explaining that to say that, in the 56 years since this book has been written, a lot has changed. For one, the Renaissance Man, Jubal Harshaw would probably have been imprisoned as a sex offender. For another, Valentine Michael Smith’s radical philosophy wouldn’t be that looked down on today in many circles. His free love commune could find safe haven somewhere in most countries, if not most cities in the United States. For that reason, the central conflict of the Stranger in a Strange Land simply don’t apply today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, there are a few things that I did like or learn from the book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-grok-or-not-to-grok&quot;&gt;To Grok or not to Grok&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually decided to read this book because a friend of mine at work mentioned how this book invented a word that has made it into the common vernacular. I didn’t know what she was talking about, but I later heard a data scientist podacst where someone used the word “grok” to explain some of the concepts a data scientist should probably master if they hope to excel in the field. I looked up where the word came to, and decided, why not give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grok means to understand a thing in it’s fullest. To get it to your bones. Like a part of who you are. In fact, that’s one of the main concepts of the book: that all things are one, and recognition of that fact brings a type of freedom transcends any other law. Anyone who can truly “grok” will become an Uberman, though everything groks whether they realize it or not. That concept sounds like a lot of what I read in seminary and I’d had enough of those debates in my early twenties. It felt like Heinline was just rehashing arguments I used to have outside my apartment, but he was doing it alone and fantasizing about sex at the same time. I wasn’t impressed. Though I really like the word and I now use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;picturing-an-uberman&quot;&gt;Picturing an Uberman&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this book and then decided to finally watch the movie Lucy, with Scarlet Johansen. It was weird because her character followed a pretty similar arch to Michael in the story. Her ability to see and know everything reminded me a lot of him.  And the concept that “if we only awakened our inner potential, we’d be Gods!” is central to A Stranger in A Strange Land. It made me wonder whether that thread or belief is an influence of this book.  I’m not sure, but from now on, there’s no way I’m going to be able to hear that nonsense without thinking of Michael Valentine Smith, the Man from Mars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;money-is-a-thing&quot;&gt;Money is a thing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great untapped areas of interest in this book was the role of money. In one of the (creepy) old covers, you can actually see the bowls of money in that are ever present in Michaels nest homes. Heinline quickly creates a conflict in his book where, due to various legal statues that had formed prior to Michaels birth, he qualified as the sole ruler and monarch of Mars, therefore inheriting a vast amount of wealth. This turned out to be preposterous because Mars was already owned by Martians, but the money had to belong to someone, so Michael got it. Since Michael comes from a Martian society with no money, the concept of money makes no sense to him and he has to struggle to learn it. Eventually, his disciples become absolute mavens at making money because of their Ubermensch powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point Michael explains that, unlike the Martians, money will always exist on earth.  Even in a society that has no need of it, there will always be a need because people will want things.  It is a somewhat preposterous idea, but it does say something about the world at the time: Heinline, for all of his imagination, could not imagine a world where communal living ultimately rules the day. Money exists, even if it serves no purpose to him. This point is telling to me because it proves itself: money is so powerful that you simply can’t get rid of it, even in Heinline’s science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is a classic, and for that reason, people should read it. I just can’t imagine anyone who isn’t like me bothering.  With that said, the point of this whole blog is to give recommendations to other people who are stuck in their commutes way more than they should be.  For that reason, if you made it through Starship Troopers (which I really liked), or if - for some reason - you’re interested in the interplay between religion, money, and government as agents of social power…then go ahead and read A Stranger in a Strange Land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recommendation-i-guess-you-could-read-it-id-hate-to-meet-someone-under-the-age-of-60-who-actually-likes-it-though&quot;&gt;Recommendation: I guess you could read it. I’d hate to meet someone under the age of 60 who actually likes it though.&lt;/h2&gt;
